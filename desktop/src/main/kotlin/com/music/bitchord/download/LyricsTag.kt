/**
 * The lyrics to write into a track [Downloads] is about to save, as LRC text.
 *
 * The same lookup the player does — [LyricsRepository], the same four
 * databases, the same user's pick of which of them may be asked — turned into
 * the one string [MediaTagger] can hand a container. A download is the moment
 * to do it: the lyrics are fetched over the connection that was already good
 * enough to pull the audio down, and they land in the file rather than in a
 * cache, so they survive the app being cleared and travel with the track if it
 * is copied off the device.
 *
 * Gated on [AppSettings.syncedLyrics] and [AppSettings.lyricsSources] rather
 * than on a switch of its own. Those settings are not about the player screen,
 * they are about whether this app may contact third-party lyric services at
 * all and which ones — and a download quietly asking a source the user
 * unticked would be the same request they said no to, made somewhere they
 * weren't looking.
 *
 * Never throws for anything but cancellation. A download that has otherwise
 * succeeded must not be undone by a lyrics server being down, which is the same
 * bargain [MediaTagger] makes for cover art.

     * providers apiece over one connection, and a lossless transfer that lands
     * in a few seconds gives the lookup almost none of the head start it was
     * budgeted. Tracks were finishing with the lookup still outstanding, which
