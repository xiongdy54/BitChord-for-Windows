// Ported from app/src/main/java/com/music/bitchord/playback/QueueShuffle.kt. The order arithmetic
// is verbatim; what goes is the cross-process half. `applyOrder` existed because a controller and
// its session hold two separate copies of the queue, and the items read back out of the controller
// have lost their URIs — so the permutation had to travel as indices for the session to apply to
// its own copy. Desktop has one list, it is already Songs, and the code computing the order is the
// code applying it: the custom-command branch and `reorderFromCommand` have nothing left to do.

/**
 * Shuffle as an edit to the queue, not a playback mode.
 *
 * ExoPlayer's own `shuffleModeEnabled` leaves the queue exactly as it is and
 * draws the next track from a hidden random order, so the queue panel shows
 * one running order while the player follows another — the user sees the album
 * listed in order and hears it jumping about. Toggling shuffle here rearranges
 * the queue itself and leaves playback strictly sequential: what the queue
 * shows is what plays, in that order.
 *
 * The order the queue was in beforehand is kept so the toggle can be undone.
 * The player's own shuffle mode is deliberately never enabled — it would
 * randomise on top of the order set here.
 *
 * User-queued tracks (USER_QUEUE) are NEVER shuffled: they reflect deliberate user
 * intent and remain pinned at the front. Context tracks (CONTEXT) and AutoPlay tracks
 * (AUTOPLAY) are shuffled among themselves.
 *
 * The rearranging itself is worked out as a permutation and applied to the
 * queue in one edit — see [applyOrder], which is where the size of the queue
 * stops mattering.
