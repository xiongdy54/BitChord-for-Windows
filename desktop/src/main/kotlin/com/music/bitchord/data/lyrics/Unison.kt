/**
 * A community-submitted lyrics database, and the only source here whose
 * contents are contributed rather than licensed.
 *
 * That is its whole character. Every other source is a window onto somebody's
 * catalogue — Apple's, Musixmatch's, KuGou's — and carries whatever that
 * catalogue has. This one carries what people have uploaded, which means it
 * occasionally has a track none of the others do, and means its coverage is
 * thin and uneven everywhere else. It sits low in the default order for
 * exactly that reason.
 *
 * Each entry is voted on, and the response says so: a `score`, a `voteCount`
 * and a `confidence`. None of it is acted on here. A fresh submission is
 * `confidence: "low"` with no votes at all, so refusing those would refuse
 * nearly the whole database, and the alternative to a lightly-voted entry is
 * usually no lyrics rather than better ones.
 *
 * Three shapes come back, and it says which: Apple-style TTML, ordinary
 * line-stamped LRC, or plain text with no timing at all.
