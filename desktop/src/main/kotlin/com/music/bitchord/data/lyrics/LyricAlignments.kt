 * Not one side per voice: the sides alternate every time the voice changes,
 * which is what keeps a three-way song reading as a conversation instead of
 * putting two of the three on top of each other. A line sung by everyone at
 * once ([GROUP]) belongs to neither side and stays on the left without
 * disturbing whose turn it is.
 *
 * The whole thing is flipped at the end if nearly every line came out on the
 * right. That happens when the song opens on the voice this walk starts the
 * alternation away from, and the result is a song laid out entirely down the
 * right-hand side — correct by the rule, and plainly not what was meant.
 *
 * Shared by every provider that says who is singing, because the answer has to
 * be the same one: the side a line sits on is a property of the song, and a
 * listener who changes provider mid-track should not watch the panel turn
 * itself inside out. [types] maps a voice to `person`, `group` or `other`, and
 * a voice with no declaration is taken for a person.
