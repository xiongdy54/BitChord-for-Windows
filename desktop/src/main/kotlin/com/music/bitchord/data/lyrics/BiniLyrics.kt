/**
 * Apple Music TTML again, from a third host — and the only one here that will
 * answer to a recording rather than to a name.
 *
 * The catalogue is the same one [BetterLyrics] serves; on a track both have,
 * the documents come back byte for byte identical. What it adds is a different
 * matcher over that catalogue, which is not nothing — it finds tracks
 * [BetterLyrics] misses, particularly outside the English-language releases —
 * and, more importantly, an index by ISRC.
 *
 * ### Why the ISRC matters
 *
 * Every other source here is asked for a title, an artist and a length, and
 * hopes. "Dracula" by Tame Impala exists as a single at 205 seconds and an
 * album cut at 206, with different words in places, and nothing in a fuzzy
 * match reliably tells those apart. An ISRC names one recording and only that
 * recording, so a lookup that has one cannot come back with the wrong edit.
 *
 * A search here also *reports* the ISRC of whatever it matched, which is where
 * [LyricsRepository] gets one to hand to the sources that can use it. That is
 * the whole arrangement: this asks by name once, and everything afterwards can
 * ask by recording.
 *
 * Two requests either way — the search returns a URL rather than the document,
 * so the TTML itself is a second fetch from the storage host.
