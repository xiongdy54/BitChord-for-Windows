/**
 * Apple Music's word-timed lyric format.
 *
 * A document is `<p>` per sung line, each holding one `<span>` per syllable
 * with its own `begin`/`end`:
 *
 * ```xml
 * <p begin="27.395" end="28.960" ttm:agent="v1">
 *   <span begin="27.395" end="27.549">I</span>
 *   <span begin="27.549" end="27.740">been</span>
 * </p>
 * ```
 *
 * Syllables of one word are written as adjacent spans with no whitespace
 * between them ("e" + "nough"), so whitespace — not the span boundary — is
 * what separates words. That is the whole trick to reading this format.
 *
 * Parsed with DOM rather than a pull parser so this stays plain JVM code and
 * can be unit tested off-device.
