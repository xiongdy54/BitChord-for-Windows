/**
 * Where the player gets its lyrics.
 *
 * Sixteen sources, tried in [order] — the user's own priority list in Settings,
 * defaulting to [LyricsSource.entries]:
 *
 *  - [BetterLyrics], [PaxSenix] and [BiniLyrics] — Apple Music TTML,
 *    per-syllable, from three independent hosts so one having a bad day
 *    doesn't cost the timing.
 *  - [LyricsPlus] — the YouLy+ backend; finest timing of the lot, flakiest hosting.
 *  - [SimpMusicLyrics] — keyed on the video id, so it can't fetch the wrong edit.
 *  - [Unison] — contributed rather than licensed; thin, and occasionally the
 *    only place a track exists.
 *  - [LrcLib], [Musixmatch], [KuGou] — line-synced only, but between them
 *    almost always up, and [KuGou] carries a lot that the others don't.
 *
 * Every enabled source is asked *at the same time*, but their answers are
 * taken in [order]: the loop awaits them one at a time in that sequence, so a
 * lower-priority source finishing first never preempts one still pending
 * ahead of it. Asked one after another instead, a miss on each source would
 * cost its own round trip before the next was even tried, and a track with no
 * lyrics anywhere would spend the best part of a minute finding that out with
 * eight of them. Run together, a miss costs whatever the slowest one needed
 * to still be waited on took.
 *
 * A word-timed answer wins outright. Failing that, a line-timed one is taken
 * from the highest-priority source that had it — better a whole line lighting
 * up in sync than the right animation on lyrics that don't exist.
 *
 * ### Matching on the recording
 *
 * Everything above matches a *name*, and a name is ambiguous in a way that
 * matters: a single and its album cut share a title, an artist and very nearly
 * a length, and routinely differ in the words. An ISRC names one recording and
 * settles it. Two sources accept one — [BiniLyrics] and [LyricsPlus] — and
 * [BiniLyrics] is also the one that hands them out, reporting the ISRC of
 * whatever its own search matched.
 *
 * So the recording is settled *before* anybody is asked for words: one small
 * search against [BiniLyrics], whose answer is a name every other source can
 * use. It costs a round trip at the head of the lookup, which is why it is
 * capped at [IDENTIFY_TIMEOUT_MS] and why its result is kept against the video
 * id — a track asked about twice pays for this once. A downloaded or local file
 * can skip it entirely: its own tags name the recording, which is what the
 * [isrc] parameter is for.
 *
 * Only run when the user has [LyricsSource.BINI_LYRICS] enabled. It is a
 * request to a third party like any other, and a source somebody has turned off
 * is a source this app does not contact — not even for something it would only
 * use to help the sources they left on.

    /**
     * [sources] is the user's pick from Settings; anything not in it is not
     * contacted at all. An empty set means no lyrics, which is the same answer
     * as switching the feature off. [order] is tried first-to-last; a source
     * missing from it (an upgrade that added one after the order was last
     * saved) falls in after everything named, in [LyricsSource]'s own order.
     *
     * [prioritizeSyllableSync] decides what happens once *something* has come
     * back: off, the highest-priority source's own answer is taken as-is,
     * word-synced or not — priority is priority, and second-guessing it with
     * more network calls after it has already answered is not what "first"
     * was supposed to mean. On, a merely line-synced answer is kept only as a
     * fallback, and the search keeps going through the rest of [order] for a
     * word-synced one, taking the top-priority source that has one.
