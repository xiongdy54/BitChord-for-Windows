/**
 * Turns parsed lines back into the text of an LRC file.
 *
 * The counterpart to [LrcLib.parseLrc], and the only writer in this package —
 * everything else here reads. It exists for the download path, which embeds
 * what it gets into the saved file's own metadata (see
 * `com.music.bitchord.download.LyricsTag`), and LRC is what that field is read
 * as: whatever a track's lyrics arrived as, they leave here as `[mm:ss.xx]`
 * stamps, which is the one synced-lyric syntax every other player understands.
 *
 * **Word timings are deliberately dropped.** Three of the four providers carry
 * them and the player uses them, but the way to keep them in a file is the
 * "enhanced" A2 extension — `<mm:ss.xx>` runs inside the line — and a reader
 * that doesn't implement it does not ignore those stamps, it *shows* them, so
 * every line reads as angle-bracket noise with words scattered through it.
 * Line stamps degrade to plain text in the same reader; word stamps corrupt it.
 * The file is for other players, so it gets the syntax they all read.
 *
 * Nothing writes the `[ti:]`/`[ar:]`/`[al:]` header tags either. The container's
 * own title, artist and album atoms sit beside this field and already say all
 * three; repeating them here would only be visible in the readers that *don't*
 * parse LRC, which are exactly the ones that can least afford three more lines
 * of markup at the top.

 * documents: a reader without A2 does not ignore a word stamp, it shows it, so
 * a file carrying only this reads as angle-bracket noise everywhere else. The
 * two are written to different fields — plain LRC to the container's own lyrics
 * atom, where every other player looks, and this to a BitChord-specific one
 * they don't read (see `Mp4Tagger`, `FlacTagger`, `WebmTagger`). Other players
 * are unaffected; this app gets the timings back off the file instead of the
 * network, which is what lets a downloaded song light up word by word offline.
 *
 * Empty when nothing here is word-synced: the plain field already says
 * everything a line-synced source had, and a second copy of it would be bytes
 * spent to learn nothing.
 *
 * Each line closes with a bare `<stamp>` at its end, which is what carries
 * [LyricLine.endMs] across — without it the last word of every line would come
 * back with no end, and the player reads a silence out of that.
