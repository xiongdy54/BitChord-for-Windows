/**
 * Lyrics from SimpMusic's community database, keyed on the YouTube video id.
 *
 * That key is what makes it worth having: every other provider matches on
 * title and artist and can hand back a different edit of the same song, which
 * drifts out of sync a verse in. This one is looking up the exact track that
 * is playing.
 *
 * Two caveats, both seen in the wild:
 *  - the host geoblocks some regions outright, answering 403 with a "Access
 *    denied from your region" body rather than a network error, so a miss here
 *    can be permanent for a given user and the chain must carry on past it;
 *  - the rich sync is served HTML-escaped — see [EnhancedLrc.decodeEntities].
