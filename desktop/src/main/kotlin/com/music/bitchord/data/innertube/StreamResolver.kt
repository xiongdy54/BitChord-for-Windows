     * The extractor's own leash on [Http.client].
     *
     * Everything NewPipe fetches — the watch page above all — goes out through
     * here, and [Http.client] sets no `callTimeout` at all. Its 30-second read
     * timeout does not stand in for one: a read timeout is per read, so a
     * response that yields a few bytes at a time resets it forever and the call
     * never ends. That is not a hypothetical failure mode but the exact shaping
     * this file's header describes Google applying to the watch page, and it
     * was observed doing it — an extraction that simply never returned, twice
     * in a row, leaving a track buffering until ExoPlayer gave up and retried
     * into the same wall. Unbounded is the one thing this call must not be,
     * because it is the failsafe: nothing runs after it.
     *
     * It gets its **own connection pool**, and that is the point of it rather
     * than a detail. Sharing [Http.client]'s pool means the watch-page GET can
     * be handed a connection to `www.youtube.com` left over from an Innertube
     * `player` POST, and a pooled connection that the far end has quietly
     * stopped answering does not fail — it hangs, silently, until something
     * times it out. `retryOnConnectionFailure` cannot save it, because nothing
     * is failing. That is exactly the shape the measurements have: a first
     * attempt that burns the whole ceiling and a second, on a fresh connection,
     * that succeeds in 2.2 seconds. Its own pool means extraction never
     * inherits a socket some other part of the app finished with.
     *
     * Sharing the pool was never required, either. The address-family argument
     * in [Http] is about a googlevideo media fetch matching the `player`
     * request that minted its URL; this fetches HTML from `www.youtube.com`,
     * and the googlevideo URL it comes back with is fetched later through
     * [Http.client] regardless.
     *
     * The ceiling is sized against a healthy extraction — about two seconds —
     * rather than against patience. Twelve is generous enough that a merely
     * slow page still completes, and short enough that a hung one costs a few
     * seconds before [EXTRACTION_ATTEMPTS] tries again on a new connection,
     * instead of half a minute of silence.

     * of the required ladder is therefore a failure with a sentence attached.

     * The container is asked of InnerTubeX up front rather than filtered out
     * of whatever it picks, because it answers with one format per ask: MP4
     * when the destination needs it, its best Opus otherwise. It has no
     * bitrate ceiling of its own, so a rung over [maxKbps] sends the download
     * on to extraction for a lower one, and is kept should extraction fail.
     *
     * Nothing here touches [recent]. That cache exists to keep ExoPlayer's
     * re-opens off the network, and its entries are picked under the *playback*
     * ceiling — seeding it from here would hand a capped connection a stream it
     * was capped to avoid, and reading from it would hand a download whatever
     * bitrate playback happened to settle for. Both directions are wrong, and
     * they are wrong independently of what [maxKbps] says.
     *
     * Extraction sits behind InnerTubeX for the same reason it does in
     * [resolve]: a download reaching a wall playback climbs over has to climb
     * it too, or it fails while the track it is refusing to save is audibly
     * playing.

     * NewPipe's full extractor, kept for the case where every player client has
     * been turned away — it re-derives everything itself and is updated
     * upstream when YouTube changes, so it works when nothing else does.
     *
     * Last rather than first because of what it costs: it scrapes the watch
     * page, which is the request Google shapes hardest, and a shaped response
     * can hold this call open for the better part of a minute. Worth waiting
     * out when the alternative is silence; not worth paying for every track.
     *
     * Driven through [StreamExtractor][org.schabi.newpipe.extractor.stream.StreamExtractor]
     * directly rather than through `StreamInfo.getInfo`, which is the obvious
     * call and the expensive one. `getInfo` assembles everything a video page
     * has — it drives forty-odd extractor methods, among them `getVideoStreams`
     * and `getVideoOnlyStreams`, and YouTube answers those with twenty to
     * thirty formats whose `n` parameter each has to be transformed by running
     * YouTube's player JavaScript. This app then discards every one of them and
     * keeps the audio. Fetching the page and asking only for [audioStreams]
     * pays that transform four or five times instead: measured on-device at
     * 49.8s against 2.3s for the same track over the same connection.
