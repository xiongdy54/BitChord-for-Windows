// Ported from app/src/main/java/com/music/bitchord/ui/player/PlayerLyrics.kt.
//
// The drawing, the timing math and the translation state machine are verbatim. The
// desktop swaps:
//   - `R.string/array` -> `Res.string/array` (compose-resources, merged from the app)
//   - `android.os.SystemClock` -> the same-named desktop shim (data/SystemClock.kt)
//   - `Toast` x6 -> DebugLog: each message already renders in the panel's status
//     line, and a desktop window has no toast surface worth building for this
//   - `AppCompatDelegate.getApplicationLocales()` -> the JVM default locale, which
//     the desktop already retargets from settings at startup
//   - `rememberIsForeground()` -> `true`: a desktop window is never backgrounded
//     out of the process, so there is no clock to pause on losing it
//   - `Build.VERSION` glow gate -> dropped: Skia's blur is not the Android 11
//     RenderEffect cliff the check existed for; reduceDynamicBlur still rules it
//   - `LyricsTranslation.translate/romanize(context, ...)` -> the desktop pair takes
//     a cache root (`AppFiles.cacheDir`), not a Context
