// Ported from app/src/main/java/com/music/bitchord/ui/player/ArtworkMeshBackdrop.kt.
//
// Every Android coupling the file had, with what replaced it:
//
//   - `android.graphics.Bitmap` (`:3`) → the pixel adapters in
//     `ui/theme/SkiaPixels.kt`: `argbPixels()` for the read the original did one
//     row at a time with `getPixels`, and `argbImageBitmap()` for the texture
//     write it did with `Bitmap.createBitmap(texels, …).asImageBitmap()`.
//     `meshOf` takes an IntArray now; its flip, its strides and its cell
//     accumulation are unchanged.
//   - the hand-written box blur (`boxBlurred` `:445` + `boxBlurPass` `:460`, 62
//     lines, and `FULL_BLUR_PASSES` with it) is deleted, and
//     `FullArtworkBlurBackdrop`'s Image carries `Modifier.blur(48.dp)` instead.
//     The original blurred a 128px copy on a worker thread because `Modifier.blur`
//     is a no-op below API 31; here Compose maps blur onto a real Skia image
//     filter (`GraphicsLayer` sets it as `Paint.setImageFilter`), so the pixel
//     pass has nothing left to buy. The decode is still 128px and still cached
//     by URL.
//   - `android.os.Build` (`:4`) — only the `SDK_INT >= S` half of `canBlur` went;
//     `reduceDynamicBlur` still asks for less, and this file still never reaches
//     for the glass path.
//   - `androidx.core.graphics.ColorUtils` (`:36`) → `colorToHsl` / `hslToColor`
//     from `ui/theme/ColorMath.kt`, which is this repo's own port of the same
//     maths; the int comes back through `Color.toArgb()`. No blend API was added
//     — the file's private `lerpArgb` already is one.
//   - `collectAsStateWithLifecycle` (`:37`) → `collectAsState`.
//   - `coil3.request.allowHardware` (`:41`) — the call is gone (desktop Skia has
//     no hardware bitmaps) and `LocalContext.current` (`:31`) became
//     `coil3.PlatformContext.INSTANCE`, as `MeshGradient.kt:225` and
//     `ArtworkPalette.kt:154` already do.
//
// `rememberArtworkMesh`'s `canvasFrame` stays in the signature, so the player's
// call site can read like upstream's, but it is typed `Any?` and only the null
// path is kept: motion artwork does not ship in this slice.

/**
 * The artwork's own colours, upside down and reduced to a mesh, for the player
 * to stand on.
 *
 * [MeshGradientBackground] answers a different question: it asks the quantiser
 * what colours a sleeve is *about* and paints four blobs of them. That is why a
 * cover that is nine-tenths black with a red stripe came out as a red screen —
 * the quantiser reports red because red is the interesting answer, and nothing
 * downstream knows how little of the picture it was. It also has no idea *where*
 * in the frame that red was.
 *
 * This is the other approach: no quantiser at all. The sleeve is averaged into a
 * [MESH_GRID] square of means; the row against the seam is kept in place, and
 * everything below it is flipped and then rotated sideways — see
 * [rotatedBelowSeam]. What the backdrop holds is the cover's own colours,
 * roughly in the cover's own proportions (nine-tenths black stays nine-tenths
 * black) and with each cell's neighbours exactly what they were in the source,
 * but not lined up in the cover's own *position*: a flip on its own reads as a
 * reflection on any cover with real structure to it — a face, a horizon, a
 * logo — however coarse the grid, because the layout still lines up column for
 * column with what's on screen above it. The rotation is what actually breaks
 * that column-for-column match; the coarseness just keeps any one cell from
 * being recognisable on its own.
 *
 * Held as a tiny bitmap rather than a list of colours because that is exactly
 * what the hardware wants: one [DrawScope.drawImage] with bilinear filtering
 * interpolates the whole mesh in the sampler. The alternative — a blob per cell,
 * as the old backdrop draws — would be thirty-six full-screen radial gradients.

/**
 * The player's backdrop: [mesh] hung from where the artwork stops, and stretched
 * over everything below it.
 *
 * The mesh is anchored rather than centred. Its first row is the sleeve's own
 * bottom edge and it is drawn starting at [seam], so the colour immediately
 * under the artwork is the colour the artwork ended on and there is no join to
 * hide. Above [seam] that first row is simply held — that stretch is behind the
 * artwork, and holding it means the backdrop is continuous everywhere rather
 * than only below the sleeve.
 *
 * ### What this costs
 *
 * A full-screen [blur] is a `RenderEffect` over every pixel on screen, and it
 * is re-applied on every frame the backdrop is redrawn — so the bill is set by
 * how much of the time something is moving.
 *
 * A still sleeve is the cheap case and the usual one: the backdrop is drawn
 * once when the track changes and is then only composited, and the crossfade
 * costs its [MESH_FADE_MS] once per skip. A playing clip is the same case
 * repeated — one fade every few seconds, with the screen still in between; see
 * `MESH_REFRESH_MS` in `NowPlayingScreen` for the cadence.
 *
 * Each of those frames is made as cheap as it can be rather than merely rare.
 * The mesh is smoothed on the CPU before it is ever uploaded (see [MESH_TEX]),
 * so the blur is polish rather than the thing making the gradient smooth and
 * can stay narrow; and a fade frame redraws two stretched 32-texel quads and
 * nothing else — no decode, no readback, no sampling, all of which happen once
 * per read and off the main thread.
 *
 * The old backdrop paid a 60Hz blur permanently, for blobs orbiting behind a
 * screen nobody was looking at; see [MeshGradientBackground]'s note. This pays
 * it in bursts, and only while a clip is actually on screen and playing.

 * The flip alone reads as a mirror on a cover with any real layout to it: a
 * face, a logo, a horizon line reappears upside down in the same columns it
 * left off in, and that symmetry is what makes the backdrop look like a
 * reflection rather than a colour field. An earlier version broke that by
 * shuffling every cell below the seam independently, which also broke the
 * *mesh*: a photo's neighbouring regions are usually close in colour, and a
 * random per-cell permutation puts wildly different cells next to each other
 * far more often than the photo itself ever did, so the smooth blend between
 * them read as a patchwork of small blended islands — a mosaic — rather than
 * the two or three broad blobs a real mesh gradient has.
 *
 * A cyclic shift doesn't have that problem: every cell keeps the exact
 * neighbours it started with, just carried around the row, so whatever
 * gradient existed between them survives untouched. What moves is *where on
 * screen* that gradient sits — which is exactly enough to stop the column
 * directly under the artwork's face or logo from being the same column that
 * face or logo was in above it, without inventing a single new boundary
 * between colours that weren't adjacent in the source.
 *
 * Seeded rather than re-rolled on every call: the same artwork should land in
 * the same arrangement each time it's read, or a canvas clip refreshing this
 * once a second (see `MESH_REFRESH_MS`) would show its layout visibly turning
 * underneath its own colours instead of just changing hue.
