 *
 * The list underneath starts scrolling at exactly one slop, and it consumes the
 * gesture when it does — so a tap that shifted by a hair more than that was not
 * merely ignored, it was taken by the list and became a browse. Every shortfall

 * Intercept a lower-half tap before a lyric row can seek; leave real drags to

 *
 * Runs on [PointerEventPass.Initial], which is what makes the disambiguation
 * possible at all: this sees each event before the list does, and while the
 * finger is still inside [TAP_SLOP_FACTOR] it *consumes* the movement, so the
 * list never reaches its own slop and never takes the gesture away. Past that
 * distance the consuming stops, the deltas flow through, and what is left is an
 * ordinary scroll that began a few pixels late.
 *
 * The dead zone that costs only exists while [enabled] — that is, only while
 * the controls are away and a tap has something to do. With them on screen this
 * detector is absent entirely and the list scrolls off its own slop as usual.
