/**
 * Heuristic to reject a frame that is almost certainly the first read after
 * a surface recreation — the decoder has not yet produced real content, so the
 * buffer is black or near-black. Mean luminance below ~12 on a 0-255 scale
 * (roughly 4.7%) is the threshold; a genuine dark cover art frame will almost
 * always exceed it because even black sleeves have noise and compression
 * artefacts that push the average up.
 *
 * The Android version sampled with `Bitmap.getPixel`; here the pixels come
 * through the same Skia adapter the quantiser uses, read once and indexed.
