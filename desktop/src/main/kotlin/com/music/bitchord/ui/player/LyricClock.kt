/**
 * Reconciles the frame-driven lyric clock with the player's slower position reports.
 *
 * The player is sampled every 500 ms, while lyrics advance once per frame. Comparing a
 * fresh report directly with the already-advanced display clock mistakes delivery delay
 * for a seek and rewinds the words. Instead, compare it with where the previous *report*
 * should have reached in the elapsed wall-clock time. Ordinary polling and main-thread
 * delay stay monotonic; an actual seek is still a large discontinuity and resets at once.
