/**

 *
 * Shortened from 120, then from 88: the blur is meant to belong to the top of
 * the screen, and at 88 the strip came to 167dp on a 1080p phone — over a fifth
 * of the display held under a blur that was only ever there to carry a 52dp
 * bar. It reads as a hazy band the page scrolls through rather than as glass
 * behind the bar.
 *
 * Shortening it is safe in the direction that used to be the problem. The
 * gradient is eased across the whole strip rather than across this run alone,
 * so a shorter strip decays to nothing *sooner in absolute distance*: the first
 * heading, which sits a fixed distance down the screen, ends up with less blur
 * behind it than before rather than more. What it costs is intensity over the
 * bar's own glyphs, which is why this cannot keep going — the tail still has to
 * reach nothing before the layer ends, or the layer's end is the edge the whole
 * fade exists to hide.

 * there the more of the layer is flat material colour rather than blurred
 * content, and the more that edge reads as a band of colour laid over the page.
 * Stopping at three quarters keeps the ramp and loses the band.

 * worst on a detail page, whose artwork runs up under the status bar, but it
 * is the same hard edge on a feed. Ordinary pages now deliberately accept that
 * bounded pane and use [TopBarBlur]. Artwork-led pages, including Replay, now
 * use their own full-bleed background with no status-bar effect layered over
 * it, so this progressive variant is no longer mounted by the app chrome.
 *
 * Fading out instead leaves the title and back arrow something to be legible
