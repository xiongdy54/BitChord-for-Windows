 * Flat colour rather than glass, deliberately. A blur here has to sample the
 * feed scrolling under it, and what it costs is paid on every frame of that
 * scroll; a gradient costs one shader over a fixed rect. The bars themselves
 * still carry glass, so the frosted look survives where it is actually read —
 * on the pill and the mini player, against a floor that is only ever a wash of
 * the colour already behind them.
 *
 * The ramp is the feathering. The top edge is fully transparent, which is what
 * keeps the strip from reading as a rectangle stuck over the feed, and the side
 * edges run to the screen edges, so they have no seam of their own to soften.
 *
 * Unlike the blur it replaced, this stays on under Reduce dynamic blur: it is
 * not a blur, it costs nothing to leave in, and with the bars filled solid it
 * is the only thing keeping content from running out from under them.
