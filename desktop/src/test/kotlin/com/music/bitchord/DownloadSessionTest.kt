/**
 * The two things about a download that are remembered rather than observed: what
 * release a batch was, and whether the user has been told how it went.
 *
 * Both are worth pinning because both fail silently. A release that isn't
 * recorded doesn't throw — it just arrives in the Downloads folder as forty
 * unrelated rows, which is exactly what it looked like before any of this
 * existed. And a visibility rule that is off by one visit is either an indicator
 * that can't be dismissed or one that was never seen, and neither is visible
 * from the code: the whole point of the rule is that it holds while nobody is
 * looking.
